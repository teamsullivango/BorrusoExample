					<h2 class="title">Vision for the School</h2>
					<p>We had three houses that were used as dormitories for the Orphaned children.They were attending their classes in a nearby schools but, because other subjects like physical Science,Computer Science and technological subjects e.g electronics ,instrumentation and electrical skills were not available in those schools. I felt that we need to do more to meet those challenges. In August 2010 Glynn Smith from Califonia with his team,myself (Clement Masondo) met with Mr Kriger Head of senior school of Felixton Collage.We discuss about the means of supporting the new school in terms of equipping  our teachers even working in partnership in the field of sport,education and skills.</p>
